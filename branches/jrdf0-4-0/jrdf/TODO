JRDF TODO List

o Implement SPARQL parser.
o Finish of generics conversion.
o Fix up javadoc (again sorry!!).
o Continue refactoring code.
o Make GraphImpl IoCed.  Take in the constructor GraphHandlers, LongIndexes and TripleFactory.  Then test drive the lot - once the interfaces have settled down - currently it's a bit of a spike.
o Once indices are refactored do indexed Graph operations.
o Finish Relational operators.
o Write a pull based RDF/XML parser.
o Fix serialization of:
  o
o Implement toString() on:
  o FalseNode

TJA: Done
o Implemented SerializationIntegrationTest and fixed all marked as serializable classes to pass test: Triple, MemNode, Node & Graph.
o Add test target for only running integration tests (as is done for unit tests now).
o Implemented readResolve() on FalseNode, TrueNode, AllConstraintExpression
