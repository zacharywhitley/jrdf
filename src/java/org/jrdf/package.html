    <title>Java RDF (JRDF) Package</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
    This top level package consists of Factories to construct on disk or in memory version of JRDF, optionally
    using Spring.
</p>

<p>
    There is a difference between on disk and persistent JRDF graphs.  On disk factories simply allow temporary graphs
    to be used without being restricted to available memory.  Persistent graphs allow a name to be given to a graph
    which is stored on disk but can be reused across program runs.
</p>

<p>
   Molecule factories create molecule stores which are an extension to RDF Graphs that allows them to be used in a
   distributed fashion (including blanks nodes).
