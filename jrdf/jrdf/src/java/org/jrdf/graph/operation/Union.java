 * <p/>
 * In the case of blank nodes, as noted in 1.5 in the RDF Semantics Document (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#unlabel) a
 * union of two graphs corresponds to a conjunction.  The merge of two separate graphs, graphs from two different
 * sources, results in a merge - where all blank nodes will retain their identity.
