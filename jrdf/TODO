JRDF TODO List

o Implement SPARQL parser.
o Finish of generics conversion.
o Fix up javadoc (again sorry!!).
o Add test target for only running integration tests (as is done for unit tests now).
o Continue refactoring code.
o Make GraphImpl IoCed.  Take in the constructor GraphHandlers, LongIndexes 
and TripleFactory.  Then test drive the lot - once the interfaces have
settled down - currently it's a bit of a spike.
o Once indices are greaters do Graph operations.
o Finish Relational operators.
o Write a push based RDF/XML parser.

TJA: Done
