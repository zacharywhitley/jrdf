JRDF TODO List

o Implement SPARQL parser.
o Continue refactoring code.
o Make GraphImpl IoCed.  Take in the constructor GraphHandlers, LongIndexes
and TripleFactory.  Then test drive the lot - once the interfaces have settled
down - currently it's a bit of a spike.
o Once indices are refactored do indexed Graph operations.
o Finish Relational operators.
  o Currently implemented: Projet, Join, Restrict, Semi-join (join and project) and Union.
  o Implement the rest as follows:
    o Difference,
    o Anti-join (difference and semi-join),
    o Left, Right, and Full Outerjoin  (join, union and antijoin).
    o Intersection (maybe - special case of join),
o Put in SPARQL Union and Optional.
o Write a pull based RDF/XML parser.
