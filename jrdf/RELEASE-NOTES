JRDF Release 0.3.3
==================
* Reification prevented from existing statements (Bug 1034837).  When
reifying it used to add the statement that was being reified to the graph
this is not the correct semantics of reification.

JRDF Release 0.3.2
==================
* Bug fixes to the in memory implementation including
serialization/deserialization (Bug 1020911) and Literal equality (Bug 1016576).
* All nodes for the in memory implementation are now localized (RFE 1016579)
allowing any JRDF object to be added/removed or used in a find/contains. 
This should be the semantics for all implementations of Graph.
* The iterators returned by the in memory Graph implementation can now have
remove called on them (RFE 1027563).

JRDF Release 0.3.1
==================
* Bug fixes to the in memory implementation: creating the same Literal by
value resulted in a different node ID (1014115) and preventing one in 
memory graph adding nodes to another in memory graph (1014054).
* Updated javadoc for Graph.

JRDF Release 0.3
================
* New memory implementation by Paul Gearon.
* Abstract unit tests to test implementations.
* Split out NodeFactory into TripleFactory and GraphElementFactory.
* Added Container (Bag, Alternative and Sequence support) and Collection
support.
* Added visitor pattern for typed nodes (URIReference, BlankNode and
Literals).
* Creating literals is restricted to only valid construction: lexical value,
lexical value and datatype or lexical value and language.
* AbstractLiteral now has a getEscapedForm which returns an N-Triples
escaped version of the Literal.  The toString now simply returns
getLexicalValue (no escaping).
* Modified AbstractURIReference to allow unchecked URIs to be added.
* Added AbstractBlankNode.

JRDF Release 0.2.1
==================
* AbstractLiteral has improved toString.
* AbstractURIReference has a constructor that enforces a non-null URI.
* Graph now has find, getNumberOfTriples and isEmpty methods.
* Triple and Nodes are now Serializable.
* NodeFactory now supports reification.
* Added ClosableIterator for results.
* Added RDF and RDFS vocabularies.

JRDF Release 0.2
================
* Node, SubjectNode, PredicateNode and ObjectNode marker interfaces.
* Renaming of Statement to Triple and other renaming.
* Defining hashCode and equals.
* Refication added to NodeFactory.
