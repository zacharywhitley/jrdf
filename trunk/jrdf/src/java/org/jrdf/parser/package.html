<p>
    This package is a port of the Sesame RIO Parser.  It has been modified to use JRDF objects instead of Sesame
    objects.  Also, a ParserBlankNodeFactory has been added to allow pluggable blank node handling.  This is
    currently achieved by an in memory version but can easily be substituted to another version that uses on disk
    indexing for example.
