    <title>Java RDF (JRDF) In Memory Graph Package</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
    This package is an implementation of the JRDF Graph API. The basis for this is an in memory index consistenting
    of three separate indexation schemes:
    <ul>
        <li>012 - Subject, Predicate, Object</li>
        <li>120 - Predicate, Object, Subject</li>
        <li>201 - Object, Subject, Predicate</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The implementation of the iterators allows deletion of the nodes as they are being iterated. There is currently
    no locking to prevent multiple access of the data structures.

    There is no transactional boundaries around the Graph although this maybe applied later or a lock free algorithm
    developed.
</p>

<p>
    The current Graph and all of its objects are serializable. This provides other implementations and client/server
    APIs a mechanism for transporting RDF data over the wire using Java's default serialization mechanism.
