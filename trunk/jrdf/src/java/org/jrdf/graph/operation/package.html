<p>
    This package defines a set of APIs for performing set based operations upon an RDF graph.  Two graphs are always
    used in these operations as defined by the SetOperation interface.  These operations include:
    <ul>
        <li>Comparison - Allows the comparison of grounded (graphs containing no blank nodes) or non-grounded nodes.
            </li>
        <li>Difference - Creates a new graph that contains all of the nodes that are in the first graph that do not
            appear in the second graph.</li>
        <li>Intersection - Creates a new graph that contains only the nodes that appear in both the first and second
            graphs.</li>
        <li>Union - Creates a new graph that contains all the nodes that appear in either the first and second
            graphs.  Being a set there are no duplicates.</li>
    </ul>
