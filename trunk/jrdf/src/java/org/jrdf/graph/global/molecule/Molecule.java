/**
 * A molecule is a container of a subgraph of RDF triples.  It contains a collection of triples that share some common
 * chain of blank nodes.  Molecules consist of a set of root triples.  These share a blank node - typically the
 * subject but it can be the object as well.  For example, _1 p o, s p2 _1 is a simple molecule.
 *
 * The highest in this set of root triples (as defined by some ordering) is the head triple.  The typical ordering is
 * most grounded (fewest blank nodes), followed by URIs, Literals and then alphabetical ordering.
 *
 *  The chain of blank nodes creates a molecule that contains submolecules.  If a triple in the root has a blank node
 * as its object it is a linking triple.  This is how the chains to submolecules are created.  From one molecule to
 * the next the object and subject nodes are swapped.  For example, the linking triple _1 p _2 will link to a triple
 * in a submolecule _2 p o.
