JRDF TODO List

o Implement SPARQL parser.
o Finish of generics conversion.
o Fix up javadoc (again sorry!!).
o Add test target for only running integration tests (as is done for unit tests now).
o Continue refactoring code.
o Make GraphImpl IoCed.  Take in the constructor GraphHandlers, LongIndexes 
and TripleFactory.  Then test drive the lot - once the interfaces have
settled down - currently it's a bit of a spike.
o Once indices are refactored do indexed Graph operations.
o Finish Relational operators.
o Write a push based RDF/XML parser.
o Add toString to Any*Nodes

TJA: Done
o Can now send simple (wildcard projection, single constraint) SPARQL queries to connections and get a result back.
o Completed SparqlQueryBuilder.
o Hooked the builder into the connection.
o Gave all static utilities private constructors.
o Added SparqlQueryBuilderIntegrationTest to hook all the connection, builder, executor, parser, analyser, etc. up.
o Cleaned up javadoc on some classes.
