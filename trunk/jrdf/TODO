JRDF TODO List

o Implement SPARQL parser.
o Continue refactoring code.
o Make GraphImpl IoCed.  Take in the constructor GraphHandlers, LongIndexes and TripleFactory.  Then test drive the lot - once the interfaces have settled down - currently it's a bit of a spike.
o Once indices are refactored do indexed Graph operations.
o Finish Relational operators.
o Write a pull based RDF/XML parser.
