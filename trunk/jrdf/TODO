JRDF TODO List

o Implement SPARQL parser.
o Continue refactoring code.
o Make GraphImpl IoCed.  Take in the constructor GraphHandlers, LongIndexes
and TripleFactory.  Then test drive the lot - once the interfaces have settled
down - currently it's a bit of a spike.
o Once indices are refactored do indexed Graph operations.
o Finish Relational operators.
  o Currently implemented: Projet, Join and Restrict.
  o Implement the rest as follows:
    o Union, Intersection (maybe) and Difference,
    o Semi-join, anti-join,
    o Outerjoin (left, right, full).
o Put in SPARQL Union and Optional.
o Write a pull based RDF/XML parser.
