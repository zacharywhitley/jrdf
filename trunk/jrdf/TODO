JRDF TODO List

o Implement SPARQL parser.
o Finish of generics conversion.
o Fix up javadoc (again sorry!!).
o Add test target for only running integration tests (as is done for unit tests now).
o Continue refactoring code.
o Make GraphImpl IoCed.  Take in the constructor GraphHandlers, LongIndexes 
and TripleFactory.  Then test drive the lot - once the interfaces have
settled down - currently it's a bit of a spike.
o Once indices are refactored do indexed Graph operations.
o Finish Relational operators.
o Write a push based RDF/XML parser.

TJA: Done
o Minor work on getting analyser to handle more than one query. Tightened up tests on static final members.
o Completed SPARQL parser for non-projection single constraint queries.
o Completed implementation of query executor.
o Replace all nulls (representing wildcards) with Any*Node.ANY*NODE constants.
o Added LiteralTripleSpec & VariableTripleSpec to make unit test simpler.
o Checkstyle
  o Remove need for {} on single line ifs
  o Allow catch to be on same line as }
  o Empty catch's OK in unit tests, e.g. catch(Exception expected) { }
