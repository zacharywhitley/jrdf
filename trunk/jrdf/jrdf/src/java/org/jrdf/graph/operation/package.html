    <title>Java RDF (JRDF) Graph Operation Package</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
    This package defines a set of APIs for performing set based operations upon an RDF graph. Two graphs are always
    used in these operations as defined by the SetOperation interface.
</p>

<p>
    Comparison allows the comparison of grounded (graphs containing no blank nodes) or non-grounded nodes.
</p>

<p>
    Difference creates a new graph that contains all of the nodes that are in the first graph that do not appear in the
    second graph.
</p>

<p>
    Intersection creates a new graph that contains only the nodes that appear in both the first and second graphs.
</p>

<p>
    Union creates a new graph that contains all the nodes that appear in either the first and second graphs. Being a set
    there are no duplicates.
